In this project we first take an image from user as an input and then we give them the appropriate caption for the given image using machine learning algorithm and also tell them number of faces found in the image. The caption generated by the software is automatically copied and you just have to paste it. 

Project working is as follows:-

We will take 5 cases determine how the algorithm works. 

Case 1: No image is selected 

Case 2: Image with 1 face is selected 

Case 3: Image with 2 faces is selected 

Case 4: Image with multiple face is selected 

Case 5: Image with no face is selected. 

 

If we don’t select any image then in output terminal it shows no image was selected in . 

 

Firstly we take a photograph which has a single face in it. After selecting the image, a popup will appear highlighting the number of faces it found in the given image. After closing the window, 

In the output terminal it shows how many faces it has found which is 1 and the next line it generates the appropriate caption for the given image. Now you can paste this caption directly 

This can also be used as status quote for whatsapp or any other relevant site. 

 

Now again same process is followed if we select an image with 2 faces in it.  

As you can see our machine learning algorithm as detected 2 faces in it and has generated the this caption. 

 

Similarly for an image with multiple faces in it. 

 

Now in the end let us take an image which has no face in it. 

As you see the algorithm shows it has not detected any face in it.
