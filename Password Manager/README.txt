This is a software used to generate random complex password for sites.

The generated password is then written in a text file (for users) and json file (for search query)

Once a random password is generated it is automatically copied, you just have to paste it on the desired site
(while the program is still running)

In email field you can change from 'abhinav@email.com' to YOUR own email by changing the line 135.

The sample saved_password.txt and sample_password.json are provided as a reference files and are not needed. 
So you can either delete the contents within the files or you can delete the files altogether.
